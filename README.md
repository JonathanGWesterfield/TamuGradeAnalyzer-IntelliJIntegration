# TamuGradeAnalyzer-IntelliJIntegration

The only reason this is named IntelliJIntegration is because I am currently trying to learn how to use github through IntelliJ (since it
is the main IDE that I prefer to use)

# What it does
This is a project which will allow me to anaylze the grades that Texas A&M professors give. When completed, it should take in the Grade 
PDF's from the TAMU registrar site, strip the text off of the pdf's and upload them to a database. Once on the database, a gui will
allow the user to see all the information about the professor by selecting the subject, course number, etc, about the class the are
trying to register for. Information seen by user will include: a bar graph of the grade distribution 
of the class, a line graph of the class with GPA from past semesters, the number of A's, B's, C's, Number of Drops, etc for a class, which also tells the user how many years that professor has taught that course. I plan to distribute this application freely to anyone who wants to use it. I only wish decent database hosting services were free.
