# TamuGradeAnalyzer-IntelliJIntegration

The only reason this is named IntelliJIntegration is because I am currently trying to learn how to use github through IntelliJ (since it
is the main IDE that I prefer to use)

This is a project which will allow me to anaylze the grades that Texas A&M professors give. When completed, it should take in the Grade 
PDF's from the TAMU registrar site, strip the text off of the pdf's and upload them to a database. Once on the database, a gui will
allow the user to see all the information about the professor by selecting the subject, course number, etc, about the class the are
trying to register for. Information seen by user will include: the raw data from the table, a bar graph of the grade distribution 
of the class, the number of A's, B's, C's, Number of Drops, etc for a class and the number of years a professor has taught that particular 
class. I plan to distribute this application freely to anyone who wants it. I only wish decent database hosting services were free.
